# Final-Year-Project
Climate Modeling using Graphical Neural Networks.

## Phase: 1
1. Introduction: background,Problem statement, Objectives.
2. Literature survey: survey of  various implemented methodologies( at least 10 papers), gap analysis, performance parameters.
3. Proposed Methodology: Dataset summary, Block diagram, Flow diagram, Mathematical formulas and model.
4. Performance analysis of 30% project implemented.
5. Conclusions.

## Phase: 2 (ONGOING)
1. End-to-End structuring of the project.
2. Creation of grids and with particular nodes to assign attributes such as temperature and rainfall.
